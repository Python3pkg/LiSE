    """A collection of :class:`Thing`, :class:`Place`, :class:`Portal`,
    and possibly even :class:`Dimension` instances that are regarded
    as one entity for some purpose.

    :class:`Character` is chiefly inspired by the concept from
    tabletop roleplaying game systems. These are normally assumed to
    represent the sort of entity that has a body, a mind, and some
    ability to affect the game world, but none of those are strictly
    needed for a character. In the roleplaying system _GURPS_, it is
    not unusual to make characters that represent vegetables, mindless
    robots, swarms of insects, vehicles, or spirits. LiSE characters
    are meant to be at least that flexible.

    LiSE assumes only that characters are diegetic items. That means
    they exist in the simulated universe, and that they are composed
    of some collection of simulation elements, including physical
    objects as well as abstractions. A quality of a physical object
    may be part of a character, even when the object itself is not,
    and likewise, characters may have qualities that no particular
    object in the simulation possesses; but even in those cases,
    characters "exist," and therefore, interact with other things that
    exist in the simulation. They do not interact with anything
    outside the simulation. It is senseless for :class:`Character` to
    perform file operations or make network connections, unless your
    game *simulates* those things, and the character is a *simulation*
    of software on a *simulated* computer. This is the meaning of the
    term "diegetic" in LiSE.

    An instance of :class:`Character` is a collection of elements in
    the simulation, of classes :class:`Thing`, :class:`Place`,
    :class:`Portal`. To deal with elements too abstract or otherwise
    inconvenient to represent with those classes, you may assign
    "stats" to a character. All of these parts are subject to change
    as time passes in the simulation. Those changes will be recorded,
    such that if you rewind time in the simulation, you get the old
    values.

    Stats are strings. There are no special restrictions on their
    values. Assigning a stat to a character results in the creation of
    a new :class:`Cause` to indicate that the stat is present. If the
    value of the stat can make a difference to whether an event
    triggers, you need to create your own :class:`Cause` for that
    case.

        """Initialize a character from the data in the closet.

        A character is a collection of items in the game world that
        are somehow related. The significance of that relation is
        arbitrary--sometimes it determines what laws of physics apply
        to the items, but it might just be a set of collectible cards
        scattered about for somebody to put together. In most games,
        there will be one character that represents the physical
        reality that all of the other characters inhabit. That
        character is conventionally named 'Physical'. Characters
        representing people will have items in 'Physical' to represent
        the characters' bodies, and items elsewhere to represent their
        minds, social relations, and whatever spiritual notions you
        choose to model in your game.

        LiSE divides the world of items into :class:`Thing`,
        :class:`Place`, and :class:`Portal`. Things are located in
        other items. Portals connect other items together. Places do
        nothing but provide points of reference for other items. If
        you need a place that moves, you can use a thing
        instead--things can be located inside other things if you
        like.

        The places and portals within a given character are connected
        together in its graph. Things refer to that graph to say where
        they are. Places can only exist in the character upon which
        they are defined, but that restriction does not apply to
        portals or things, both of which have a 'host' character that
        may or may not be the character on which they are
        defined. Thus, parts of some characters can occupy other
        characters. That makes it possible for the physical body of a
        person to occupy someplace in the character called 'Physical',
        and thereby exist in the physical world without necessarily
        being a part of it.

        Note that it is possible for something to be part of more than
        one character at a time. This is desirable for when, eg., six
        adventurers band together to form a party, which looks a lot
        more intimidating as a group than any of its individual
        members. The party in that instance would be a new chanacter
        containing all the same things as the six who make it up, and
        it would have its own intimidation stat, among others.
